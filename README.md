This project is an IoT based agricultural monitoring and support system. This project is dedicated to provide a simplified UI/UX for the farmers to access it remotely. 
The IoT platform was created using Thingsboard and was integrated with the wireless sensor network which comprises a DHT11 temperature sensor, a Soil-moisture sensor, and which are powered by an ESP32 microcontroller. The parameters which were measured and updated in the IoT system were temperature of the surroundings of the field and the soil moisture.
